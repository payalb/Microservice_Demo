DESCRIPTION:Microservice architectures are popular\, described as &quot\;s
 ervice-oriented architecture (SOA) done correctly.&quot\; But what does th
 at mean? Many aren&#39\;t quite sure what the differences are between ente
 rprise service bus (ESB)-flavored service-oriented\, service-based\, and m
 icroservice architectural styles\, to say nothing about the middle ground 
 between the &quot\;shared everything&quot\; approach of SOA and the &quot\
 ;shared nothing&quot\; approach of microservices. If you&#39\;ve been wond
 ering the same thing\, or if you just want a refresher on what makes these
  approaches distinct\, this is the course for you.\n\nJoin Neal Ford to ex
 plore the similarities and differences between various distributed archite
 ctural styles. You&#39\;ll explore the origins of distributed computing vi
 a event-driven architectures and dive into the characteristics of ESB-driv
 en SOA\, microservices\, and hybrid service-based architectures. Along the
  way\, Neal discusses specific engineering practices\, orchestration style
 s\, reuse strategies\, and how to migrate between architectural styles (e.
 g.\, from monolithic applications to service-based or microservice archite
 ctures). \n\nNo one architecture can solve every problem\, and many projec
 ts take on more complexity than necessary by choosing the wrong architectu
 ral pattern. This course will equip you with the knowledge and context to 
 choose the architecture that best fits your problems.\n\nGo to the event (
